# GWAS & Mendelian Randomization Project on Cardiovascular Disease

this repository documents a training project focused on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Mendelian Randomization (MR), specifically exploring genetic risk factors for **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**.

---

## üß¨ Overview

This project integrates two main components:

1. **GWAS Analysis Pipeline** ‚Äì Using PLINK, R, and Bash to perform genome-wide association studies on synthetic genotype/phenotype data.
2. **Mendelian Randomization Analysis** ‚Äì Investigating the causal effects of **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** on **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** using MR and **Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR)** techniques.

The aim is to understand the relationship between cardiometabolic traits and CAD through modern genetic epidemiology tools.
